    <p class="fade-in">Sorting algorithms can be tricky to wrap your head around—numbers 
        moving, comparisons happening, swaps being made—it all gets confusing fast! 
        That’s where our Sorting Visualizer comes in.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">Instead of just reading about how sorting works, why not see it
        in action? Just enter your numbers, pick a sorting algorithm, and watch as the 
        bars move, swap, and organize themselves right before your eyes. Every step is 
        visualized, making it easier (and way more fun) to understand.</p>

    <p id="nextPage" class="fade-in">
        Whether you're a student trying to learn sorting, a developer brushing up on 
            algorithms, or just someone who enjoys watching things fall into place—this 
            tool is for you!
